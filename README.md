# Source2Suffering 

**This repository contains the Lifetime Exposure to Climate Extremes framework from Thiery et al. (2021) Science.**

**The following scripts are used as a baseline to define the workspace for the Source2Suffering project.** 

**The "work_comp" branch is the one associated with the Working Computer of Amaury Laridon and is only use to investigate and run the matlab scripts of Thiery et al.(2021)**

## Structure

- The `lifetime_exposure_wim_v1/` folder contains the matlab scripts (R2020a) associated with the original Thiery et al.(2021) publication.
- The `lifetime_exposure_wim_v2/` folder contains the matlab scripts associated with the updated work perform by Prof. W.Thiery in 2025. This update is correction for being able to run the scripts on Matlab R2024b
- The `matlab_scripts/` folder contains the matlab scripts for different subroutines used in the lifetime exposure framework.
